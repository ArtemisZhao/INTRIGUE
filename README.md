# INTRIGUE
## Quantify and Control Reproducibility In high-throughput Experiments
This package propose an algorithm to quantify and control reproducibility in high-throughput experiments. It estimates the proportions of the null, the reproducibility and irreproducibility signal groups for the input data set. A Bayes factor calculation and EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm procedures are included.
